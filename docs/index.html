            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <h3>Skills and Expertise</h3>
        
            As a beginner in web development, I have gained foundational knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
            and PHP. These skills have enabled me to create and design basic websites, 
            and I am continuously working to improve my proficiency in these areas. Additionally, 
            I have started learning Java, which has broadened my understanding of programming concepts 
            and object-oriented design. I am eager to further develop my expertise in these languages 
            and explore new technologies to enhance my capabilities as a developer.
            
            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>I am a third-year BSIT student at the City of Malabon University. 
                My studies have given me a solid foundation in IT, including programming, network management,
                and systems analysis. Although my program lacks a specific major, I have explored various subjects
                within the field, developing a well-rounded skill set.
                I am committed to continuing my education and staying at the forefront of technological advancements.
            <h3>Passions and Interests</h3>
            <p>Outside of work, I am passionate about basketball, both playing and supporting my favorite teams. 
                I also enjoy MOBA games, which help me develop critical thinking and teamwork skills. Additionally, 
                I am eager to expand my knowledge in coding languages, 
                constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow to enhance my ability to create innovative projects.

            <h3>Goals and Aspirations</h3>
            <p>My goal is to become a skilled web developer or a dedicated policeman in the cyber department. 
                I am passionate about technology's potential to create positive change, whether through innovative web 
                solutions or protecting digital spaces from cyber threats. I am committed to continuous learning and 
                growth, aiming to make a meaningful impact by combining my technical skills with a strong sense of duty 
                to contribute to a safer and more connected world.
            <h3>Personal Anecdotes</h3>
            <p>Throughout my journey, I faced numerous challenges and successes. 
                One memorable experience was when I first started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                 Despite the steep learning curve and various obstacles, I persevered and successfully completed a 
                 simple website project. This experience taught me the importance of persistence and continuous learning, 
                 sparking my interest in web development and motivating me to explore other programming languages like 
                 PHP and Java.
                 This journey has shaped my approach to problem-solving and reinforced my passion for technology.
